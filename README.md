## Speech-to-Speech LLM
# Overview
The Speech-to-Speech LLM (Language Model) is a sophisticated tool that processes speech input in one language and generates speech output in another language (or the same language), enabling seamless and efficient communication. Leveraging advanced language models and state-of-the-art speech recognition and synthesis technologies, this system enables users to translate, transcribe, and generate spoken content in real-time.

# Key Features
Speech Recognition: Convert spoken language into text for further processing.
Text-to-Text Translation: Use a powerful language model to translate or transcribe text into another language (if applicable).
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Convert the processed or translated text back into natural-sounding speech.
Real-time Processing: Provides near-instantaneous conversion and feedback for real-time interaction.
Multi-language Support: Compatible with a wide range of languages for both speech recognition and synthesis.
Contextual Understanding: Utilizes advanced LLM capabilities for better handling of context, tone, and meaning.
Installation
To get started with the Speech-to-Speech LLM, follow the steps below.

# Requirements
Python 3.7+ (Recommended: 3.9+)

```bash
pip (Python package installer)
Speech recognition library (e.g., speech_recognition)
Text-to-Speech engine (e.g., pyttsx3 or cloud-based TTS like Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly)
Optional: Deep learning models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, custom LLMs, or translation models)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-speech-llm.git
cd speech-to-speech-llm
Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Set Up API Keys (If Required)
If you're using a third-party API (like Google Cloud Speech or TTS), set up the necessary keys in the environment variables or configuration file.

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
Step 4: Run the Application
For local testing, you can run the application with:

```bash
python app.py
Usage
Once the system is set up, you can interact with the Speech-to-Speech LLM using the command-line interface (CLI) or the provided API.

Example CLI Interaction:
```bash
python speech_to_speech.py --source_lang en --target_lang es
