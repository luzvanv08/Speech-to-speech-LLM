## Speech-to-Speech LLM
# Overview
The Speech-to-Speech LLM (Language Model) is a sophisticated tool that processes speech input in one language and generates speech output in another language (or the same language), enabling seamless and efficient communication. Leveraging advanced language models and state-of-the-art speech recognition and synthesis technologies, this system enables users to translate, transcribe, and generate spoken content in real-time.

# Key Features
Speech Recognition: Convert spoken language into text for further processing.
Text-to-Text Translation: Use a powerful language model to translate or transcribe text into another language (if applicable).
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Convert the processed or translated text back into natural-sounding speech.
Real-time Processing: Provides near-instantaneous conversion and feedback for real-time interaction.
Multi-language Support: Compatible with a wide range of languages for both speech recognition and synthesis.
Contextual Understanding: Utilizes advanced LLM capabilities for better handling of context, tone, and meaning.
